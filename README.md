Pick-Place-Robot-Arm

  A robot arm powered by 3 servo motors, controlled with an Arduino Uno and 6 buttons, which can pick up small objects from various heights and move them to a specified location.
  
  The robot was made out of popsicle sticks, wood glue, small metal strips, scotch tape, and zipties along with the wires, servo motors, and Arduino Uno required for the movement.
  
  For the testing of this device, a golf ball was lifted and placed on top of a soda can approx. 10cm away. The task in reverse could also be completed. 

Controlling the Arm:
  Note that for simplicity, all buttons used were pushbuttons however any button which completes the subcircuit can be used.
  
  Base Servo: Use buttons attached to pins 6 and 7 to control counterclock-wise and clockwise movement respectively
  
  Arm Servo: Use buttons attached to pins 8 and 9 to control counterclock-wise and clockwise movement respectively
  
  Mouth Servo: Use buttons attached to pins 10 and 11 to control counterclock-wise and clockwise movement respectively
